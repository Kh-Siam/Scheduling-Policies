# Operating Systems' Scheduling Policies

This code simulates different scheduling policies applied by operating systems.

Scheduling Policies included are:
- First Come First Serve
- RoundRobin
- Shortest Process Next
- Shortest Remaining Time
- Highest Response Ratio Next
- Feedback 
- Feedback 2^i
- Aging

For the code to run, it waits for an input types in the next format
```sh
Type of display required
The time required to be foreseen by the code
Number indicating which policy is required
The number of processes to be run
name of process, arrival time, service time
```

Example
```sh
trace
1
20
5
A,0,3
B,2,6
C,4,4
D,6,5
E,8,2
```

> There are two types of displays, Trace and Stats

You can find plenty of examples in the testcases folder with how each testcase's output should look like.
